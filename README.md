# 🚗 Salifort Motors – HR Analytics Capstone Project

This project is part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Specialization** final capstone. It demonstrates end-to-end analytics and predictive modeling to help Salifort Motors' HR team understand and address employee attrition.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a data-driven model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. The goal is to support HR in identifying at-risk employees and designing targeted retention strategies.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Identified strong predictors of attrition such as **low satisfaction**, **long working hours**, and **low recent evaluation scores**.
- Built and evaluated a **[logistic regression / random forest]* model** to classify employees who are likely to leave.
- Provided **actionable HR recommendations** based on model results and feature importance.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning:** Classification models (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
- **Model Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Visualization:** Correlation heatmaps, bar charts, feature importance

---

## 📊 Methodology Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
   - Handled missing values
   - Explored distribution of features
   - Visualized attrition drivers

2. **Modeling**
   - Chose classification approach
   - Split data into training/testing/validation sets
   - Trained and evaluated model

3. **Results Interpretation**
   - Highlighted key predictors
   - Provided recommendations for HR action

---

## 📈 Results

- **Model AUC Score:** `98%`
- **Top Predictors of Attrition:**
  - Low satisfaction level
  - High average monthly hours
  - Poor last evaluation

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Monitor employee satisfaction regularly
- Reduce overwork and balance project allocation
- Provide constructive and regular performance feedback
- Develop retention programs for high-risk employees

---

## 🧭 Ethical Considerations

- Avoid bias in model predictions (e.g., by gender or department)
- Ensure transparency in how predictions are used by HR
- Protect employee data privacy
